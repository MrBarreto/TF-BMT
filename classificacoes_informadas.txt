🤔 Thinking... 💭 Processing... 📊 Calculating... 👀 Analyzing... 🗣️ Voice Assistant ready! 🎙️ Here is my answer: Yes.
🤔 Thinking... 💭 Hmmm, based on the content of the tweet, it appears that the user is referring to a sports event or competition. The use of hashtags such as #PATHAAN DEKHEGA HINDUSTAN and @WayneRooney suggest that the event is related to Indian football or cricket, possibly a match between India and England featuring Wayne Rooney. However, without more information, I cannot confirm whether this tweet specifically refers to sports betting or not. 🤔
